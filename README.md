# Halide

Halide is a minimalist image portfolio template, ready for deployment to Netlify.

It uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Eleventy Image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) under the hood to generate static HTML pages from Markdown, and responsive images in next-gen formats like AVIF and WebP.

It doesn't use a front-end framework, and only contains a few lines of vanilla JavaScript to provide some progressive enhancement. Halide leverages native browser features as much as possible. For example, the `loading` attribute for native image lazy loading and the `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media feature.

Halide also comes with [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/) pre-configured. Tina CMS is an open source, headless content management system that uses GitHub as a robust and convenient content store.

## [Demo Site](https://halide.netlify.app)

## Features

- Responsive, static HTML front-end
- Tina CMS for git-based content management
- [Eleventy Image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) for optimized images in next-gen formats
- Optional dark mode support
- Customizable theme settings, colors, and typography
- Simple asset minification pipeline
- Clientside framework-free
- Uses Markdown files for content
- Simple YAML configuration
- Netlify build caching for faster deploys
- Automatic Content Security Policy

## How it works

Halide site settings are stored inside `_/data/settings.yaml`

It stores project data as `.md` files inside the `projects` folder, and stores source images inside the `assets/uploads` folder.

Halide generates a set of up to 12 optimized image files per source image. Images are cached between builds (local and Netlify). The generated images are not stored in your GitHub repo; only the source image is stored. If the build cache is ever lost or expires, each image will be re-generated from its source on the next build, and cached.

Halide's page structure is very simple. Apart from the [404 page](https://halide.netlify.app/nope), there are just 2 views:

- [Home](https://halide.netlify.app)
- [Project](https://halide.netlify.app/project/british-gq/)

By design, there are no additional pages for a bio, contact etc. You could easily add them if you wanted to, though.

## Getting started

Halide requires a number of services to be configured before it can be deployed. If you don't already have accounts with the following providers, you'll need to set these up first. Each providerâ€™s free plan is sufficient for most use-cases.

1. GitHub
2. Netlify
3. Tina Cloud (if you want to use Tina CMS)

When you've created accounts with the providers listed above, you can proceed with the steps below to set up Halide.

## Setup

Pressing the Deploy to Netlify button below will clone this repo and configure a Netlify site for it.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/danurbanowicz/halide#TINA_CMS_CLIENT_ID=replace-with-your-tina-cms-client-id&TINA_CMS_TOKEN=replace-with-your-tina-cms-token&TINA_CMS_SEARCH_TOKEN=replace-with-your-tina-cms-search-token)

You can also clone or fork this repo and create a new Netlify site for it manually.

### Step 1: Configure Tina CMS

Note: The bulk of the configuration relates to Tina CMS, so feel free to skip this step if you're happy working with Markdown and YAML files directly.

1. Navigate to your Tina Cloud [projects dashboard](https://app.tina.io/projects)
2. Create a new custom project, and follow the steps to connect it to your GitHub repo with the required permissions
3. Enter a project name and the live site URL you will use for your your Halide site and press Create Project
4. Navigate to your Tina Cloud project settings and make a note of the client ID, and the Content and Search tokens listed in the Tokens section
5. In your Netlify account, navigate to Site configuration > Environment variables and replace the dummy values for `TINA_CMS_CLIENT_ID`, `TINA_CMS_TOKEN`, and `TINA_CMS_SEARCH_TOKEN` with the actual values as noted in the previous step

### Step 2: To do

### Step 3: To do

### Local development

You might want to make some more advanced changes to Halide to make it your own, and to make this easier you can set up local development.

If you want to use Tina CMS, you will need to follow the account setup steps discussed above and prefix the Eleventy build command with Tina CMS' own build command.

1. Make a new directory and navigate to it

```
mkdir my-site-name
cd my-site-name
```

2. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/danurbanowicz/halide.git
```

3.Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Customization

Halide aims to be more or less ready out of the box for a non-developer user to get up and running. Because of this, it is fairly opinionated with regards to visual design and site structure, but it should be trivial for developer users to use as a base for their own design, or to extend with additional pages or functionality.

### Styles

The [main stylesheet](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/halide/tree/main/_includes/assets/css/base.css) doesn't use any CSS framework, is pure CSS, and is about 7KB in size. It's pretty simple and you are encouraged to modify it to fit your own needs.

CSS variables are configured in `_data/settings.yaml` are declared in `_/includes/assets/css/theme.njk`.

The main stylesheet can be found at `_/includes/assets/css/base.css`. The CSS is bundled and minified during build and output in the head `<style>` tag. Minification settings can be found in the [Eleventy config](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/halide/blob/c9bf4efab88d86e2d514e01b9bbd93f281c65161/.eleventy.js#L154C12-L154C12).

### JavaScript

Halide uses minimal clientside JS which can be found at `_/includes/assets/js/`. JS is bundled and minified during build and output inside an inline `script` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.

If you have enabled Google Analytics, the necessary scripts will be output in this location.

# Halide

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing Halide from Jamstack Templates to build your image creator portfolio website. Halide has been designed with simplicity, speed, and ease of use in mind. No coding necessary!

To get the most from Halide, there are a few steps that you need to do before installing. If you need some help during setup, you can find support info at the bottom of this page.

### How does Halide work?

Halide is built around Jamstack principles. It uses separate services that join together to create a distributed, secure system to build pre-rendered content, serve it from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), and to allow you to make edits to your website easily.

- GitHub: where the Halide code repository and your image and text content is stored
- Netlify: the service that builds your website from the Halide GitHib code and content, and deploys it to a global CDN
- Tina CMS: the React-based CMS that you log in to to make changes to your website content and settings

When you make an edit to your website using the CMS and hit save, the changes are immediately pushed to your GitHub repository. GitHub then tells Netlify to build your website and deploy it for you. All of this happens automatically in the background. This is sometimes called a Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow.
